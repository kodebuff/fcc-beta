# Basic CSS

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML. CSS is case-sensitive, be careful with your capitalization.

CSS has been adopted by all major browsers and allows you to control:

* color
* fonts
* positioning
* spacing
* sizing
* decorations
* transitions

Three main ways to apply CSS styling:

* Inline styles directly to HTML elements with the style attribute.
* Place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document.
* Write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML document.

The idea behind CSS is that you can use a selector to target an HTML element in the DOM (Document Object Model) and then apply a variety of attributes to that element to change the way it is displayed on the page.
